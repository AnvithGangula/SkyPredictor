### 🚀 **About The Project**

**SkyPredictor** is a web-based weather application that provides accurate and timely weather forecasts. It was founded in 2024 by a team of passionate meteorologists and technology enthusiasts. The goal was to combine advanced meteorological science with cutting-edge technology to deliver forecasts that are not only precise but also easy to understand.

**Key technologies and libraries used in this project include:**
* **HTML:** Provides the structure for all web pages, including the homepage, about, and weekly forecast.
* **CSS:** Used for styling the entire application, including custom fonts like `Jost`, `DM Sans`, and `Poppins`, and a responsive design approach.
* **JavaScript:** Powers interactive elements such as the dynamic contact card, form validation for registration, and dynamic weather data display.
* **Bootstrap:** Used for the layout and styling on the weekly weather forecast page.
* **Font Awesome:** Provides the icons for buttons on the weather page.
* **Axios:** A JavaScript library for making HTTP requests, which is likely used to fetch weather data from an API.
